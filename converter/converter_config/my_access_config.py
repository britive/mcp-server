Use this tool to retrieve details of the currently authenticated identity (user or service). 
It returns information like username, type (user/service), and any other associated metadata.

When to Use:
- When the user asks questions like:
  - "Who am I?"
  - "What user is currently logged in?"
  - "Tell me about my account"
  - "What is my identity?"

- When the user refers to themselves using:
  - Words like "I", "me", "my", "mine"
  - Phrases that imply a self-reference (e.g., "my secrets", "my roles", "my entitlements")

- When another tool requires an identity as input, but the user did not specify one.
  - In such cases, use `whoami` first to fetch the identity, and then pass it to the next tool.

Constraints:
- Only use this tool when the user is referring to themselves.
- Do **not** use this tool when the user is asking about someone else.""",
